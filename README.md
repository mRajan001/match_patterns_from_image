# Match the pattern

This is a fast and simple technique to find particular pattern in the image.

I received a task to find ellipses from the image. This was my simple approach to find the ellipses. 

The dataset contained mixed images with ellipses of different sizes and colours.  To match the pattern, different types of ellipses were cropped and used as a template. 

## Dependencies
Python 3.6
OpenCV 3.2
MTM 1.5.3
scikit-image 0.17.2


## Setup 
To match the patterns, used Multi-Template-Matching
``` 
pip install Multi-Template-Matching
```

Note: NUmPy and Scipy should matches below versions to avoid error.
NumPy 1.18.1
Scipy 1.1.0
